# Progetto_PPM

Ready to use, first of all install Docker, i used Docker Desktop and it worked for me.
Unzip the directory and open it. When you are in the directory with: requirements, Dockefile.. etc. Run the command:
- docker compose build
- docker compose up
  
Go to localhost:5050 on your browser and start to play. Enjoy!
